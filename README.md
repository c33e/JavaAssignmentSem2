This program is a Topic Modeller, made for the general purpose of detecting how similar two files are or are not. 
I have created it using two files: Sunflowers.txt and Wildflowers.txt which I will have included, but works on any text file. 

It is controlled through a GUI, the button clicks activate the methods. It opens the files, reads in their contents, cleans them i.e removal of stopwords and some characters. There is an option to add a word to the stopwords list in case their is a word the user wants to omit. The program compiles a list of the common words in the two files, as well as the top 10 words in each individual file and then the top 10 words in the files joined as one. I aimed to make the program decide whether the files are similar or not due to the overlap of similar words in the top 10 lists, but the program currently deciphers similarity based on a number. 

I am running Java version 11.04.14 and programming through Eclipse IDE.

No supplementary installations needed to run this.
